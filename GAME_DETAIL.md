# Game Detail

## User Flow
xperience (XP) Needed to Level Up
The amount of experience required to reach the next level will increase as your SilPet grows, providing a sense of progression and increasing challenge.

Formula: XP_Required_for_Next_Level = Current_Level * Base_XP_Multiplier

Let's set the Base_XP_Multiplier to 50.

So, the XP required for each level will be:

Level 1 to Level 2: 1×50=50 XP

Level 2 to Level 3: 2×50=100 XP

Level 3 to Level 4: 3×50=150 XP

Level 4 to Level 5: 4×50=200 XP

...and so on.

When your SilPet accumulates enough experience to meet or exceed the XP_Required_for_Next_Level, it will level up. Upon leveling up, the pet's experience points will reset to 0, and any excess XP gained from the activity that caused the level-up will carry over to the new level.

Experience (XP) Gained Per Activity
To incentivize engagement with all types of recovery activities, those requiring more effort or introspection will yield more XP.

Cleaning Activities (Click Management):

XP Gained: 5 XP

Rationale: These are simple, quick interactions. They provide a small but consistent stream of XP, rewarding basic, frequent pet care.

Writing Diary Entries (Playing Mechanism):

XP Gained: 10 XP

Rationale: Writing diary entries involves reflection and a bit more effort than a simple click. This moderate XP reward encourages users to regularly engage in self-expression and introspection.

Recording Failure Stories (Feeding Mechanism):

XP Gained: 15 XP

Rationale: Confronting and recording failure stories is a significant and often challenging part of a personal growth journey. This activity provides the highest XP reward to strongly motivate users to engage with this crucial aspect of their recovery.
